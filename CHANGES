2007/02/15:
Portability fix in Makefile and Makefile.shared (avoided "which").

2006/12/15:
Portability fix in Makefile.shared (replaced "&>" with "2>&1 >").

2006/06/23:
Made a slight restriction to Pager's criterion so as to never introduce
fake conflict tokens (see Lr0.compatible). This might help make conflict
explanations more accurate in the future.

2006/06/16:
Fixed bug that would cause positions to become invalid after %inlining.

2006/06/15:
Fixed --depend to be more lenient when analyzing ocamldep's output.
Added --raw-depend which transmits ocamldep's output unchanged (for
use in conjunction with omake).

2006/06/12:
Fixed bug that would cause --only-preprocess to print %token declarations
also for pseudo-tokens.
Fixed bug that caused some precedence declarations to be incorrectly
reported as useless.
Improved things so that useless pseudo-tokens now also cause warnings.
Fixed bug that would cause %type directives for terminal symbols to
be incorrectly accepted.
Fixed bug that would occur when a semantic action containing $i keywords
was %inlined.

2006/05/05:
Fixed problem that caused some end-of-stream conflicts not to be reported.
Fixed Pager's compatibility criterion to avoid creating end-of-stream conflicts.

2006/04/21:
Fixed problem that allowed generating incorrect but apparently well-typed
Objective Caml code when a semantic action was ill-typed and --infer was
omitted.

2006/03/29:
Improved conflict reports by factoring out maximal common derivation contexts.

2006/03/28:
Fixed bug that could arise when explaining a conflict in a non-LALR(1) grammar.

2006/03/27:
Changed count of reduce/reduce conflicts to allow a comparison with ocamlyacc's diagnostics.
When refusing to resolve a conflict, report all diagnostics before dying.

2006/03/18:
Added display of FOLLOW sets when using --log-grammar 2.
Added --graph option.
Fixed behavior of --depend option.

2006/01/06:
Removed reversed lists from the standard library.

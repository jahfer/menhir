Description: Parser generator for OCaml
 Menhir is a LR(1) parser generator for OCaml. It is mostly compatible
 with the standard ocamlyacc and has the following enhancements:
 * it accepts LR(1) grammars,
 * it offers parameterized nonterminal symbols as well as a library of
   standard definitions,
 * it explains conflicts in terms of the grammar,
 * it allows grammar specifications to be split over multiple files and
   parametrized by OCaml modules,
 * it produces reentrant parsers.

REQUIREMENTS

You need Objective Caml 3.09 or later and GNU make.

HOW TO INSTALL

Run the following command:

  make PREFIX=/usr/local all install

If your machine does not have the native code Objective Caml compiler
(ocamlopt), but does have the bytecode compiler (ocamlc), then instead
of the above command, use:

  make PREFIX=/usr/local TARGET=byte all install

The value of the PREFIX variable can be changed to control where
the software, the standard library, and the documentation should
be stored. These files are copied to the following places:

  $PREFIX/bin/
  $PREFIX/share/menhir/
  $PREFIX/doc/menhir/

Documentation includes a reference manual and a number of demos.

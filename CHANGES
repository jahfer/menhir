2009/02/04:
A Makefile fix to avoid a problem under Windows/Cygwin.
Renamed the ocaml-check-version script so as to avoid a warning.

2008/09/05:
Ocaml summer project: added --interpret, --table, and --suggest-*.

2008/08/06:
Fixed a problem that would cause the code inliner to abort when a semantic
value and a non-terminal symbol happened to have the same name.

2008/08/06:
Removed code sharing.

2008/06/20:
Removed an incorrect assertion that caused failures (lr1.ml, line 134).

2007/12/05:
Disabled code sharing by default, as it is currently broken. (See Yann's
message; assertion failure at runtime.)

2007/12/01:
Added an optimization to share code among states that have identical
outgoing transition tables.

2007/08/30:
Small Makefile change: create an executable file for check-ocaml-version in
order to work around the absence of dynamic loading on some platforms.

2007/05/20:
Made a fundamental change in the construction of the LR(1) automaton
in order to eliminate a bug that could lead to spurious conflicts --
thanks to Ketti for submitting a bug report.

2007/05/18:
Added --follow-construction to help understand the construction of the
LR(1) automaton (very verbose).

2007/05/11:
Code generation: more explicit qualifications with Pervasives so as
to avoid capture when the user redefines some of the built-in operators,
such as (+).
Added a new demo (calc-param) that shows how to use %parameter.

2007/03/22:
Makefile improvements (check for PREFIX; bootstrap in bytecode now
also available). Slight changes to OMakefile.shared.

2007/02/15:
Portability fix in Makefile and Makefile.shared (avoided "which").

2006/12/15:
Portability fix in Makefile.shared (replaced "&>" with "2>&1 >").

2006/06/23:
Made a slight restriction to Pager's criterion so as to never introduce
fake conflict tokens (see Lr0.compatible). This might help make conflict
explanations more accurate in the future.

2006/06/16:
Fixed bug that would cause positions to become invalid after %inlining.

2006/06/15:
Fixed --depend to be more lenient when analyzing ocamldep's output.
Added --raw-depend which transmits ocamldep's output unchanged (for
use in conjunction with omake).

2006/06/12:
Fixed bug that would cause --only-preprocess to print %token declarations
also for pseudo-tokens.
Fixed bug that caused some precedence declarations to be incorrectly
reported as useless.
Improved things so that useless pseudo-tokens now also cause warnings.
Fixed bug that would cause %type directives for terminal symbols to
be incorrectly accepted.
Fixed bug that would occur when a semantic action containing $i keywords
was %inlined.

2006/05/05:
Fixed problem that caused some end-of-stream conflicts not to be reported.
Fixed Pager's compatibility criterion to avoid creating end-of-stream conflicts.

2006/04/21:
Fixed problem that allowed generating incorrect but apparently well-typed
Objective Caml code when a semantic action was ill-typed and --infer was
omitted.

2006/03/29:
Improved conflict reports by factoring out maximal common derivation contexts.

2006/03/28:
Fixed bug that could arise when explaining a conflict in a non-LALR(1) grammar.

2006/03/27:
Changed count of reduce/reduce conflicts to allow a comparison with ocamlyacc's diagnostics.
When refusing to resolve a conflict, report all diagnostics before dying.

2006/03/18:
Added display of FOLLOW sets when using --log-grammar 2.
Added --graph option.
Fixed behavior of --depend option.

2006/01/06:
Removed reversed lists from the standard library.
